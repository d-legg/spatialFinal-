# This is our Spatial data final Project
###### Group Members: Dylan Legg and Nicolas Sundberg
***Concept:*** Python program that accepts any csv file using Pandas/GeoPandas.read_file, and then the user inputs to manipulate the file. The program will use the geopandas function in the background and use the user inputs as shortcuts to changing or viewing the data. We are hoping to create some kind of shortcut to basic functions so that you can focus on more complicated functions. 

***Python Packages*** 
+ Pandas
+ Numpy
+ Matplotlib
